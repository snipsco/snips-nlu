# Snips NLU


The [Snips NLU](https://snips-nlu.readthedocs.io) (Natural Language Understanding) is a Python library that allows to parse sentences written in natural language and extracts structured information.


## Installing

```bash
pip install snips-nlu
```

## A simple example

Letâ€™s take an example to illustrate the main purpose of this lib, and consider the following sentence:

```
"What will be the weather in paris at 9pm?"
```

Properly trained, the Snips NLU engine will be able to extract structured data such as:

```json
{
   "intent": {
      "intentName": "searchWeatherForecast",
      "probability": 0.95
   },
   "slots": [
      {
         "value": "paris",
         "entity": "locality",
         "slotName": "forecast_locality"
      },
      {
         "value": {
            "kind": "InstantTime",
            "value": "2018-02-08 20:00:00 +00:00"
         },
         "entity": "snips/datetime",
         "slotName": "forecast_start_datetime"
      }
   ]
}
```
