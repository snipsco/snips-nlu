How to Contribute
=================

Contributions are welcome! Not familiar with the codebase yet? No problem!
There are many ways to contribute to open source projects: reporting bugs,
helping with the documentation, spreading the word and of course, adding
new features and patches.

Getting Started
---------------
* Make sure you have a GitHub account.
* Open a `new issue <https://github.com/snipsco/snips-nlu/issues>`_, assuming one does not already exist.
* Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.

Making Changes
--------------
* Fork this repository.
* Create a feature branch from where you want to base your work.
* Make commits of logical units (if needed rebase your feature branch before
  submitting it).
* Check that your changes are `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ compliant (for instance using Pycharm or pylint).
* Make sure your commit messages are well formatted.
* If your commit fixes an open issue, reference it in the commit message (f.e. ``#15``).
* Run all the tests (if existing) to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

These guidelines also apply when helping with documentation.

Submitting Changes
------------------
* Push your changes to a feature branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a ``Pull Request``.
* Wait for maintainer feedback.
